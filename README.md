#### Author: Dumitrascu FIlip-Teodor

Before going to bed, turn on the device, set the alarm by pressing the button and see the time entered on the LCD and press start (another button). After the time expires, the buzzer sounds and the sleep results are sent to external device through WiFi connection: how restless the user was measured by the accelerometer, whether the user snored or noise was produced and whether the temperature was ideal for sleeping. Advices are given for better sleep in the future.
